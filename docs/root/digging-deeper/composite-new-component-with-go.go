Any Go function that returns an ~htmlgo.HTMLComponent~ is a component,
Any Go struct that implements ~MarshalHTML(ctx context.Context) ([]byte, error)~ function is an component.
They can be composite into a new component very easy.

This example is ported from [Bootstrap4 Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/):

You can see from the example, We have created ~Navbar~ and ~Carousel~ components by
simply create Go func that returns ~htmlgo.HTMLComponent~.
It is easy to pass in components as parameter, and wrap components.
By utilizing the power of Go language, Any component can be abstracted and reused with enough parameters.

The ~Navbar~ is a responsive navigation header, Resizing your window, the nav bar will react to device window size and change to nav bar popup and hide search form.

For this ~Navbar~ component to work, I have to import Bootstrap assets in this new layout function:

You can utilize the command line tool [html2go](https://github.com/sunfmin/html2go) to convert existing html code to htmlgo code.
By writing html in Go you get:

- The static type checking
- Abstract out easily to different functions
- Easier refactor with IDE like GoLand
- Loop and variable replacing is just like in Go
- Invoke helper functions is just like in Go
- Almost as readable as normal HTML
- Not possible to have html tag not closed, Or not matched.

Once you have these, Why generate html in any interpreted template language!
