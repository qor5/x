  html component when using ~ReloadPortals~ together with ~web.Portal().EventFunc("related")~
- ~Reload~ is to reload the ~web.PageFunc~, before reload, you can set ~ctx.Flash~ object to let the
  event func render the page differently (flash message, validation errors, etc)
- ~Location~ is to change the browser url with push state, and AJAX load the page of that url
- ~RedirectURL~ is to change the browser url without AJAX, reload the whole page html includes it's
  head script, css assets
- ~ReloadPortals~ is for reload the portal that uses ~web.Portal().EventFunc("related")~
- ~UpdatePortals~ update the portal specified by the name ~web.Portal().Name("hello")~, ~pu.AfterLoaded~
  set the javascript function that execute after the portal is updated, for example:
  ~VarsScript: "setTimeout(function(){ comp.vars.drawer2 = true }, 100)"~
- ~Data~ is for any AJAX call that want pure JSON, you can set ~er.Data = myobj~ to any object that
  will marshals to JSON, and on the client side use javascript to utilize them
